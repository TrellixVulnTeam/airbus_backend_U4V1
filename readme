-- Install pipenv
Pipenv is a package manager which works on top of pip to ensure the dependencies are locked.
This also enables us to setup local development env quickly. If not already installed, install pipenv from brew or pip.

pip3 install --user pipenv
# or
brew install pipenv


-- Set up env

pipenv shell


-- Create database content_tag_db
brew install postgresql
brew services start postgresql
psql postgres

psql (13.1)
Type "help" for help.
postgres=# create database content_tag_db;


-- Every database change is represented in migrations. Hence initially and after every schema change we need to migrate.
python manage.py db init


-- Runserver
python manage.py runserver
